      question: "What does the postcard look like?",
      answer: "A sturdy 5x7 postcard on glossy stock. Real words, real ink, mailed to your representative."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it really handwritten?",
      answer: "Yes. The robots use real pens, with natural variations in letter shape and spacing â€” indistinguishable from human handwriting"
    },
    {
      question: "Do postcards actually matter?",
      answer: "Research shows postcards bypass long mail screening, arrive faster than letters, and get prioritized over mass emails. Congressional staff pay attention to constituent mail."
    },
    {
      question: "How do the robots work?",
      answer: "We connect your message to robots that hold real pens and write each card uniquely. Then we drop it in the mail."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I know when my card is sent?",
      answer: "Yes. You'll get a confirmation email once your card has been mailed."
    },
    {
      question: "Is this only for one political side?",
      answer: "No. Canary is proudly non-partisan. It works for anyone who wants their voice heard."
